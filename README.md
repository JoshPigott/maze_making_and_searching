# maze_making_and_searching
This project generates a perfect random maze and provides a GUI for visualising and exploring it.

Maze Generation

  The maze is created using a randomised algorithm that depends on two constants:
  grid width and cell size.
  
  The generator produces a perfect maze, meaning every cell is reachable and there is exactly one unique path between any two cells.

Maze GUI

  The GUI displays the maze and handles all drawing and interaction.
  
  It allows you to run different path-finding algorithms on the maze.

Path-Finding Algorithms

  The project includes two search methods:
  
  Depth-First Search (DFS)
  
  Breadth-First Search (BFS)

  The GUI can import and run either algorithm, letting you see how each one explores the maze.
